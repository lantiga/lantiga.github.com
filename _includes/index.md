I'm CEO at [Orobix](http://www.orobix.com), where we are busy taking artificial intelligence into the real world.

I'm located in Bergamo, Italy. You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lantiga) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/lantiga).

## Stuff

I have a PhD in Bioengineering and worked in research until 2009. Here's my list of [publications](/publications.html).

Over the years I have developed [vmtk](http://www.vmtk.org), a toolkit for modeling blood vessels from medical images, and contributed a few algorithms to [ITK](http://www.itk.org) and [3DSlicer](http://www.slicer.org).

My latest interests revolve around deep learning, using A.I. to challenge the status quo of about anything and functional programming.
