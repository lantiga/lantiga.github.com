# Solo ([Live Demo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo/))

[Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo) is a Jekyll theme that supports **single-page websites** only, but supports them well. Yes, it's responsive.

## Solo is useful if...

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and host it under a custom domain name.
* You want to create a single-page website that's mostly text, like [Know Your Company](https://knowyourcompany.com/).
* You want to share a single markdown file and tried GitHub Gist ([example](https://gist.github.com/dypsilon/5819504)), but would like something nicer-looking.
* You want something like GitHub's [automatic page generator](http://pages.github.com/) for a non-code repository.

## Examples

* This page itself is built with Solo. Try it out from [the github repo](https://github.com/chibicode/solo).
* [My personal site](http://chibicode.com) is built with Solo. It's generated from [this markdown file](https://github.com/chibicode/chibicode.com/blob/gh-pages/_includes/index.md).
* Two of my Japanese personal sites ([#1](http://j.chibicode.com/) and [#2](http://waza.chibicode.com/)) are also built with Solo.

## Usage

First, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then download Solo from its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/poole/poole). Start Jekyll and you should see this page up and running.

**The main file you'll be editing is `_includes/index.md`**. This becomes the content for the main `index.html`.

### Other Files

* Edit `_config.yml` to change the site title.
* Edit `_includes/head.html` to add custom code to `<head>`.
* Edit `_includes/scripts.html` to add custom code before `</body>`.
* Edit `CNAME` to host on a custom domain.
* Edit `README.md` before pushing your code.

### Don't use `<h1>` tags

Wthin `index.md`, do not use `<h1>` tags - `<h1>` is reserved for the site title.

### Supported Tags

Solo supports lists, `<hr>`s, `<table>`s,

> blockquotes, and...

~~~html
<pre>code blocks with syntax highlighting.</pre>
~~~

### Keep Solo up to date

Instead of downloading, you can [fork Solo](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/fork) and use the "upstream" strategy described on [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to keep Solo up to date.
